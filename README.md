# Student Fee Submission Analysis: Linear vs Parallel Processing
The Student Fees Processor is a Python-based project designed to manage and process student fee information efficiently. It performs the following tasks:

### Creates CSV Files:
student_info.csv: Contains student details such as student_id, name, and age.
student_fees.csv: Contains fee-related details like student_id, fee_paid, and fee_due.

### Combines CSV Files: 
Merges the two CSV files based on the student_id to create a comprehensive dataset.

### Processes Data:
Serial Processing: Processes the combined data sequentially.
Parallel Processing: Processes the combined data concurrently using multiple CPU cores.

### Measures Execution Time: 
Compares the performance of serial and parallel processing by displaying their respective execution times.

## Features

Data Generation: Automatically generates sample student and fee data.
Data Merging: Efficiently combines multiple datasets based on a common key.
Parallel Computing: Utilizes Python's concurrent.futures for parallel data processing to enhance performance.
Performance Measurement: Provides insights into the efficiency gains from parallel processing.
Scalability: Easily adaptable to larger datasets with minimal modifications.

## Execution Time Comparison

The project compares the execution time of serial and parallel processing methods. Here's a sample output:

    Serial Processing Time: 0.0023 seconds
    Parallel Processing Time: 0.1304 seconds
    Both serial and parallel processing results are identical.

Note: For small datasets (e.g., 100 records), serial processing may be faster due to the overhead of managing multiple processes. However, parallel processing proves beneficial for larger datasets, offering significant performance improvements.
